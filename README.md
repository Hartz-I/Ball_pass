# Ball_pass

Hey! Welcome! This is a game that I tried to make without any guidance! 

## How to play:

### Easy!

 - Press 'Space' to start!
 - Left player will control the bat using 'q' and 'a'
 - The right player will control using 'p' and 's'
 - if the ball is missed by a player other player will gain point!
 - first to reach 3 points wins!
